		<h3>THIS WEEK'S FEATURED FAN THEORY</h3>
		<div class="side-news">
		<h4>HOW WILL THE AVENGERS PREVAIL</h4>

		<p>
			There have been many rumors regarding how the team of Avegers will defeat their new-found nemesis, and there has been a new popular theory on the rise created by the great people of the internet.
		</p>

		<p>
			The common trend describes a rather unusual but just as creative way this heroic team has planned out their final blow to the commercially liked character of Thanos (played by Josh Brolin).
		</p>

		<p>
			Our heroes have tried many ways of trying to take Thanos down, but the only actual result of trying to inflict damage on him was a small cut and just a tiny drop of blood (if you disregard Thor showing his axe in Thanos' chest later on the movie).
		</p>

		<p>
			But all of those attempts had one thing in common; they were all external attacks.
		</p>

		<p>
			The most discussed theory on all of social media now suggests that the way of defeating Thanos is from the 'inside'. This particular plan involves Ant-Man and his ability to shrink down to enter hardly accessible places, in this instance Thanos's body and then expand to make the titan explode from the inside out.

	<h3>THIS WEEK'S TOP STORIES</h3>

	<h4>HELLBOY 2019: AN UNEXPECTED, BUT WELCOME REBOOT</h4>

		<div class="top-stories-article">
			<p>
				Lionsgate films has released a pair of new trailers for its upcoming reboot of Mike Mignola’s classic comic, Hellboy. The new trailers — a red and green band spot — give us a good look at the film’s plot, and presents a much better feeling than the first trailer did.
			</p>
			<p>
				The film is a reboot of the film franchise, with The Descent and Game of Thrones director Neil Marshall helming the project, featuring Stranger Things’ David Harbour as the movie’s titular demon. The new trailers outline what we can expect for the plot of the film, and covers some of the familiar beats of Hellboy’s origin story. During World War II, Hellboy was summoned from Hell by Nazis looking for an edge in the later days of the war. He was instead adopted by the US, and raised under the auspices of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, an agency designed to help fend off paranormal threats.

	<h4>CAPTAIN MARVEL: MEDIOCORE MAVEL MOVIE, MEANS IT'S NOT WORTH WATCHING?</h4>

		<div class="top-stories-article">
			<p>
			The MCU now has a Goku. There is a long running joke in Dragonball Z abridged where when a good guy is losing a fight, the villain would mock them by saying "just wait for Goku." By the end of the movie, Captain Marvel is so powerful that absolutely nothing is a threat. Not the main villain, not the orbital bombardment fleet, and not the hundreds of soldiers and warfighters sent against her.
			<p>
				The reason she wasn't present in the other movies is explained, but IMO it is a cop-out. When Captain Marvel inevitably wipes the floor with Thanos in end game, the Dragonball Z knockoff saga that is now the MCU will be complete, last minute Goku/Superman syndrome and all. But that's the MCU. How does the movie stand on it's own? My answer: solid 6.5/10.
			</p>
			<p>
			 With Captain Marvel being so powerful, the story hook is focused mainly on Captain Marvel's struggle with fabricated memories, as well as a war where the sides don't seem so clear cut. The set up is perfect for a story about an OP character, and the general story beats worked out great. The Effects and choreography were par for the course for MCU movies (good), and the acting was Mostly done well. In terms of the movie itself, I had several issues. The pacing felt off in many of the scenes, with a few weird glaring continuity errors right at the start of the movie.
